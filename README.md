# Perl-Processing
Find motifs like TTCATTCATTCA with Perl and get the positions.
This repository includes one perl file, one input file and one result file.
Still, we need chromosome data which can be downloaded from NCBI database and that's larger than 25MB limitation, thus I didn't upload it here.

See FASTQ file processing [here](https://github.com/JudeYu99/Perl_Processing/blob/FASTQ-Processing-without-Module/).
